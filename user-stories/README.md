# Ì≥ò Airbnb Clone Backend ‚Äì User Stories

This document outlines key user stories based on the use case diagram for the Airbnb Clone backend system. Each story captures essential interactions from the perspective of the platform's core users: Guests, Hosts, and Admins.

These user stories serve as a foundation for guiding feature development, defining acceptance criteria, and supporting Agile project planning.

---

## ÌæØ Purpose

To translate the core functionalities of the Airbnb Clone into user-centered stories that clearly articulate the **who**, **what**, and **why** of each backend interaction.

---

## Ì±• Core User Stories

### 1. Guest Account Registration
**As a guest, I want to register an account so that I can search for and book properties.**

### 2. Property Listing (Host)
**As a host, I want to add property listings so that I can rent out my spaces to potential guests.**

### 3. Booking a Stay
**As a guest, I want to book a property for specific dates so that I have a place to stay during my trip.**

### 4. Payments and Payouts
- **As a guest, I want to securely pay for my booking so that my reservation is confirmed.**
- **As a host, I want to receive payouts automatically after bookings are completed so that I‚Äôm compensated for hosting.**

### 5. Leave a Review
**As a guest, I want to leave a review after my stay so that I can share my experience with other users.**

## Ì¥ß Next Steps

These user stories will be expanded into:
- Detailed acceptance criteria
- API endpoint specifications
- Backend service tasks (e.g., database schema, controllers, validations)

They will also be prioritized and tracked through issue boards (e.g., GitHub Projects, Jira, Trello).

---

## Ì≥å Notes

- These stories are derived directly from the approved use case diagram.
- Additional stories for Admins, Notifications, and Error Handling will be added as the project progresses.
